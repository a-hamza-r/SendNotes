# ShareNotes

A website for sharing notes between students for each course. Right now, it is being developed only for the Florida State University (FSU). It is a semester project for Concurrent, Parallel and Distributed Programming course at FSU. 

## Progress

Right now, the project is under progress and is not in a working condition. The repository will get updated once the project is completed. Till then, stay tuned :)
